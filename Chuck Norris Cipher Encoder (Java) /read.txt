Chuck Norris Cipher Encoder (Java) 

Secret agents use encryption all the time. You know that everything can be encrypted as different characters. 
What about encryption that uses only one character and space? This method has a name â€” the Chuck Norris cipher. 
In this project, you will create a program that can encrypt any text into a sequence of zeros and spaces and decrypt this 
sequence into text.
